# IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION
## Introduction

The Iris flower dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into one of these three species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, feature scaling, and encoding target labels.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Training various classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- **Visualization:** Visualizing the dataset, model results, and important insights.
- **Documentation:** Providing detailed documentation, code comments, and usage examples.
